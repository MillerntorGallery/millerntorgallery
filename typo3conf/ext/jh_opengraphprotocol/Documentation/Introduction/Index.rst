Sponsoring
----------

Developing an extension requires time and time is money. As developer
I am proud to create open source products. But without money nothing
I can not buy any bread.

So if you think that this is a great extension feel free to by me a
beer or a coffee via paypal: `https://www.paypal.com/cgi-
